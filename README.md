# Project overview

The aim of this project is to evaluate whether Machine Learning can be used to automatise playlist creation.

Moosic wants the data science team to use a dataset that has been collected from the Spotify API and contains the audio features (tempo, energy, danceability…) for a few thousand songs using a basic clustering algorithm such as K-Means to divide the dataset into a few clusters.

We used the following tools and skills:

- Data Cleaning & Quality Assurance
- Data Preprocessing: Scaling
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- Data Visualization (3D Scatterplot),
  
To answer these questions:

- Are Spotify’s audio features able to identify “similar songs”, as defined by humanly detectable criteria?
- Is K-Means a good method to create playlists?
